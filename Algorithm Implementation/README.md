## üîç Breadth-First Search (BFS)
**How it Works:**  
BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving deeper. It uses a **queue** data structure.

**Steps:**
- Start from the source node  
- Visit all immediate neighbors  
- Move to the next level  
- Mark visited nodes  

**Applications:**
- Shortest path in unweighted graphs  
- Web crawlers  
- Network broadcasting  
- Social networks (friend-of-friend search)

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(V + E)**  
- Space: **O(V)**  

**Example Output:**  
`A B C D E F G H I`

---

## üå≤ Depth-First Search (DFS)
**How it Works:**  
DFS explores as deep as possible along one path before backtracking. It uses a **stack or recursion**.

**Applications:**
- Path finding  
- Topological sorting  
- Cycle detection  
- Maze solving  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(V + E)**  
- Space: **O(V)**  

**Example Output:**  
`A G H I B E F D C`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
**How it Works:**  
A variant of DFS that stops when a **depth limit** is reached.

**Applications:**
- Fixed-depth game trees  
- Resource-limited searches  
- Infinite-path avoidance  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(b^d)**  
- Space: **O(d)**  

**Example Output:**  
`Target not found within depth`

---

## üîÅ Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
**How it Works:**  
Combines BFS‚Äôs completeness with DLS‚Äôs low memory. Repeats DLS with increasing depth limits.

**Applications:**
- Game trees  
- Pathfinding with unknown depth  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(b^d)**  
- Space: **O(d)**  

**Example Output:**  
`Target found at depth 4`

---

## üí° Best-First Search
**How it Works:**  
Selects the path that appears best using a **heuristic function (h(n))**.  
Uses a **priority queue** for node selection.

**Applications:**
- GPS navigation  
- Robot pathfinding  
- AI games  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(b^m)**  
- Space: **O(b^m)**  

**Example Output:**  
`0 1 3 8 9`

---

## üéØ Beam Search
**How it Works:**  
Similar to Best-First Search but limits the number of nodes considered at each level (beam width).

**Applications:**
- Machine translation  
- Speech recognition  
- Image captioning  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(b √ó k)**  
- Space: **O(b)**  

**Example Output:**  
`Goal found at node 7`

---

## üîÑ Bidirectional Search
**How it Works:**  
Runs two searches ‚Äî forward from start and backward from goal ‚Äî meeting in the middle.

**Applications:**
- Shortest path  
- Route planning  
- Social graph search  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(b^(d/2))**  
- Space: **O(b^(d/2))**  

**Example Output:**  
`Target found at depth 3`

---

## üß© Bidirectional Path Search
**How it Works:**  
Extends bidirectional search by reconstructing the full path once the two searches meet.

**Applications:**
- GPS systems  
- Robot motion planning  
- Game pathfinding  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(b^(d/2))**  
- Space: **O(b^(d/2))**

**Example Output:**  
`Path found: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D`

---

## üåü A* (A-Star) Search
**How it Works:**  
A* Search is a **best-first search algorithm** that finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node using a **heuristic function**. It combines **path cost (g(n))** and **heuristic estimate (h(n))** to determine the next node to explore:

\[
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
\]

**Steps:**
- Initialize the open list with the start node  
- Calculate `f(n)` for all neighbors  
- Select the node with the lowest `f(n)`  
- Repeat until the goal is reached or no nodes remain  
- Reconstruct the path from start to goal  

**Applications:**
- GPS navigation systems  
- Robot path planning  
- Video games (pathfinding)  
- Network routing  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: **O(b^d)** (worst case, depends on heuristic)  
- Space: **O(b^d)**  

**Example Output:**  
`Path found: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí D ‚Üí G`
