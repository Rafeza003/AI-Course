## 📊 Algorithm Performance Summary

### ⚙️ Algorithm Time & Space Complexity

| 🧩 Algorithm | ⏱️ Time Complexity | 💾 Space Complexity | 📝 Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|
| **A\*** | O(b^d) | O(b^d) | b = branching factor, d = goal depth |
| **AO\*** | Exponential (worst) | Exponential (worst) | Depends on graph structure |
| **Beam Search** | O(b × k) | O(b × k) | k = beam width |
| **Bidirectional Search** | O(b^(d/2)) | O(b^(d/2)) | Efficient when goal depth known |
| **Alpha-Beta Pruning** | O(b^d) / O(b^(d/2)) | O(b × d) | Best-case with perfect pruning |
| **Minimax** | O(b^d) | O(b × d) | Used in decision-making games |
| **BFS** | O(b^d) | O(b^d) | Complete but memory-heavy |
| **DFS** | O(b^m) | O(b × m) | m = max depth |
