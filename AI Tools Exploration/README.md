# 🎥 AI Course Video & Presentation Creation Process

This document describes the complete process of how I created the **AI Course Video** and **Presentation**, including the tools, steps, and resources used.

## 🧠 1. Idea Generation

The first step was to generate ideas and structure for the AI course video and presentation.  
I used **ChatGPT (by OpenAI)** to brainstorm and outline the content, including:

- The main AI course topics  
- Logical flow and sequence of lessons  
- Key points for each algorithm and visual style suggestions  

**Tool Used:** ChatGPT

## ✍️ 2. Prompt Writing

After deciding on the topics, I used **GeneratePromptAI** to create professional and effective prompts for video generation.  
This helped structure the narration and visuals according to each AI algorithm.

This tool generated high-quality prompts aligned with my course’s goals and made the script creation process much easier.

This free online platform allows users to convert text scripts into **professional-looking animated videos** with AI-generated visuals and voiceovers.

**Tool Used:** InVideo AI

## 🖼️ 4. Presentation Creation

After completing the video, I created a professional **AI Course Presentation** using **Gamma App** and **Canva**.  
Both are free, web-based tools for making interactive and animated slides.

### 🧰 Tools Used:
- **Gamma App:** For interactive, AI-assisted presentation generation

### 🪜 Steps Followed:
1. Selected a **modern, minimal template**  
2. Added all AI course topics with short, clear bullet points  
3. Used **icons, animations, and transitions** to visualize algorithms  
4. Maintained consistent **color scheme and typography** for a professional look
